## About Me

I am 39 years old and have worked in the construction industry all my life. A few years ago, I became curious about how websites are made. I began to study html and css. It seemed to me that I began to understand it , and most importantly - I enjoy it. And I decided to become a specialist in the front end in order to completely change the field of activity.
